The topic I have finalized on is Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition (DnD 5e), a tabletop role-playing game. The specific data I am looking at is character creation choices from approximately 8,000 DnD 5e players all over the world.

The data sources I will be using are from https://github.com/oganm/dnddata, a Github repository which compiles data on character choices in DnD 5e into an R package.
